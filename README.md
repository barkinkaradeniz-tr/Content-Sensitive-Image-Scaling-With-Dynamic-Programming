# Content Sensitive Image Scaling With Dynamic Programming
## About Repository
With content-aware image resizing or seam carving,
one of the two image dimensions is reduced in such a way that the essential image elements are not changed in a most possible strategy. 

Following techniques were used to implement this tasks:
- Dynamic Programming
- Depth First Search
- Pixel Operations Using Matrices

When the image scaling occurs, deleted pixels are shown as a yellow thunder.

## Example Image 

![](/img/1.png =250x250)
![](/img/2.png =250x250)
